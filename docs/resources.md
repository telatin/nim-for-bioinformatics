## Resources

The Nim community is not very large, but it's active and friendly.
- [Nim learning resources](https://nim-lang.org/learn.html) from the Official website
  - Nim, an short tutorial ([Part 1](https://nim-lang.org/docs/tut1.html) and [Part 2](https://nim-lang.org/docs/tut2.html))
- [Nim basics](https://narimiran.github.io/nim-basics/): an excellent resource for beginners
- [Nim by examples](https://nim-lang.org/learn.html), a series of short snippets to show the basics
- [Nim notes](http://leetschau.github.io/nim-notes.html), a very long page on most Nim's features
- [ðŸ“™ Nim in action](https://www.manning.com/books/nim-in-action), a well written book, unfortunately not updated to the last version

Of course, [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nim-lang) can be used to ask questions on Nim, too.

## Nim for Bioinformatics

I strongly suggest having a look at the paper by Brent Pedersen and the blog post by Heng Li: they provide a good insight on the benefits of Nim for bioinformatics:

- 17 May 2020 - **[Fast high-level programming languages](https://lh3.github.io/2020/05/17/fast-high-level-programming-languagesâ€‹)**: a blog post by Heng Li
- 01 Oct 2019 - **[hts-nim: scripting high-performance genomic analyses](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/34/19/3387/4990493)**: a paper by Brent Pedersen and Aaron Quinlan
