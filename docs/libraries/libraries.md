# Libraries
{: .no_toc }

Nim comes with a good number of libraries that can be divided in **pure libraries** (written in pure Nim),
**impure libraries** (libraries that require some external library `*.so`), and **wrappers** (impure libraries
  that are low-level interaces to C libraries).

This section comes with minimal worked examples.
